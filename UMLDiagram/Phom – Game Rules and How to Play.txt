Phom – Game Rules and How to Play

- Objective
The goal of Phom is to form valid sets of cards (called bands) and minimize the total points of your remaining cards.

- Number of Players
2 to 4 players.

- Play with a standard 52-card deck.

- Key Terms
+ Phom: A valid group of cards. It can be:
Three or more cards of the same rank (e.g., 5♠ 5♥ 5♣), or
A straight of three or more cards in the same suit (e.g., 6♦ 7♦ 8♦).
+ Discard: To throw away one card at the end of your turn.
+ Eat: To take the card just discarded by the previous player (only if it helps you create a band).
+ Draw: To take a new card from the draw deck.
+ Send: On your turn in the last round, if others have bands, you can send your matching cards to their bands.
+ Show: Show your bands on your turn in the last round.
+ Remaining cards: Your cards that are not in any band at the end of the game.

- Setup
Players join the table.
Wait until all players are ready.
Shuffle and deal the cards:
+ Each player receives 9 cards.
+ The dealer gets 10 cards and plays first.
+ The remaining cards become the draw deck.

- Game Flow
Each player takes turns in clockwise order.
On your turn:
If the previous player discarded a card then you can eat it and discard a card.
If not eat it then you draw a card and discard a card.
The next player takes their turn.
In the last round if you are first player then show your bands, if not then you can send your cards then show your bands.

- Game End
The game ends after 4 rounds, or if someone "U".
At the end:
Remaining cards are counted:
Ace = 1 point
2 to 10 = face value
J, Q, K = 10 points
A player who has no remaining cards outside of bands is considered to "U".

- Ranking
Players are ranked based on their total remaining points:
Lowest total = best rank.
If someone “U”, they win automatically.

- After the Game
Players may choose to exit or start a new game.
