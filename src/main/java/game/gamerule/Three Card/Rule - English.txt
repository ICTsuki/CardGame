3 CAY (THREE CARDS) GAME RULES

1. Deck:
- Standard 52-card deck.
- Only use cards from A to 9 in each suit (10, J, Q, K are removed).

2. Number of players:
- From 2 to 9 players.

3. Dealing cards:
- Each player receives 3 cards.

4. Scoring:
- Add up the values of all 3 cards.
- A = 1 point, 2–9 = face value.
- Only the unit digit of the total is counted (e.g., 18 points = 8 points).
- If all 3 cards are of the same suit, it’s called “liêng” (flush) and is ranked separately.

5. Comparing scores:
- Higher score wins.
- If tied, compare suits: Diamonds > Hearts > Clubs > Spades.
- If suits are also tied, it’s a draw.
