Vietnamese Northern Poker Game Rule - English

1. OVERVIEW:
- Northern Poker is a shedding card game played with a standard 52-card deck.
- Players: 2 to 4.
- Objective: Be the first to play all your cards.

2. CARD RANKING:
- Card values in ascending order: 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A < 2
- Suits ranked from weakest to strongest: Spades < Clubs < Diamonds < Hearts
- The 2 is the highest value card, but has restrictions when being played.

3. GAMEPLAY:
- Each player is dealt 13 cards.
- The player with the 3♠ (Three of Spades) starts the game.
- Players must beat the previous play with a higher-ranking hand of the same type or pass.
- You are not forced to play, even if you can.

4. VALID COMBINATIONS:
- Single: Any one card.
- Pair: Two cards of the same value, different suits.
- Triple: Three cards of the same value.
- Straight: 3 or more consecutive cards (different suits, no 2s allowed).
- Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value (can beat a 2).
- Double Sequence: 3 or more consecutive pairs (can beat a 2 in some rules).

5. SPECIAL "BEATING" RULES:
- Cards with value 2 can only be beaten by:
  + A Four of a Kind
  + A Double Sequence of 3 or more pairs (depending on house rules)
- The 2♥ (Two of Hearts) is the strongest single and can only be beaten by combos.
- 2s are not allowed in straights.

6. END OF ROUND:
- The first player to play all their cards wins.
- Players who still hold cards may receive penalties:
  + Holding 2s, Four of a Kind, or combos may result in heavier fines.
  + Holding all 13 cards is called "full hand" or "instant loss" – double penalty.

7. OPTIONAL HOUSE RULES:
- Chain Beating: A special combo can beat a previously played combo.
- No playing 2 as the final card.
- Instant Win Conditions (auto-win if holding certain combinations):
  + Four 2s, six pairs, five pairs + one triple, 12-card straight, etc.

8. STRATEGY TIPS:
- Try to get rid of single cards early to avoid being stuck with them.
- Save powerful cards (Aces, 2s) for defense later in the game.
- Watch other players’ moves to guess what combos they may have.

GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!
